## Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to help users understand the functionality and limitations
behind this program. A series of flags as well as all external requirements are listed in order to
ensure proper use. Visual examples are also included, as well as different conditions that will
yield an error message within the program.

## Overview of the Program

Characters from a text file are read and formatted into a new text file based on the flags
listed in the original text file. The flags are listed on the start of a new line in the text file in the
format of a ‘-’ followed by the character for the flag. The following 12 possible valid flags are
listed below.
**Flag Function**
-l Left Justified
-c Center
-r Right Justified
-t Title
-d Double Space
-s Single Space
-n Remove Indentation
-i Indent first line by 5 spaces
-b Indent multiple lines by 10 spaces
-1 1 column
-2 2 columns
-e Blank Line


The program will also include a feature allowing the user to preview the text file that will
be generated by the save file feature. A feature for logging errors to the user interface is also
present, allowing users to identify and trace back operations performed on the original text file
that result in errors.

## External Requirements

In order to use the program the user should download the Eclipse IDE from
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/​. As this program only necessitates that the Java JVM is
installed on the user’s machine, the user is also free to use any Java IDE or the Java shell as
alternatives to Eclipse.

## Getting Started

In order to run the program, the program needs to be downloaded from
https://github.com/JohnTheMiner/360-Project​.

Then run the cse360GroupProject-1.0.0.jar file in the folder named "target".

## Ending the Program

The close window button on the top right of the program window will end the program.
Any progress the user has made in the program will be lost if the user does not save their final
text file. In order to save any progress made, click the ​ _Save As_ ​button to save the modified
output to any desired local directory.
